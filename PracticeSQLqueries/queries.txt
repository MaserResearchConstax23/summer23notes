Practice 1. What objects has the SDSS seen in a smaller area of the sky near 
ra = 194.5, dec = 2.5 (the same area you searched in the previous query)?

Modify the previous query so it will return ra and dec of objects where the ra
is between 194.25 and 194.75 and the dec is between 2.25 and 2.75. About how
many objects did the query return? Does this seem to make sense, given the
smaller area you searched here?


select ra, dec, specObjID, objTypeName
from SpecObj
where ra BETWEEN 194.25 and 194.75 AND
dec BETWEEN 2.25 and 2.75



Practice 2. Which of the objects you found in Practice 1 are galaxies?

Open the Schema Browser. Click on views and select SpecObj. You will see a list
of all the columns in the SpecObj table. If you click on the  Link to PhotoType
symbol, you will see the various values that column may have. For instance, the
"specClass" column may contain numbers that correspond to stars, galaxies,
quasars, etc. Modify your query so that it returns the ra, dec, and best object
ID for galaxies (and only galaxies) whose ra is between 194.25 and 194.75 and
whose dec is between 2.25 and 2.75.

select ra, dec, specObjID, objTypeName
from SpecObj
where ra BETWEEN 194.25 and 194.75 AND
dec BETWEEN 2.25 and 2.75 AND
objTypeName = 'GALAXY'




Practice 3. What are the reddest galaxies in the area of sky near ra = 195?

Write a query to search for galaxies between ra = 194.9 and ra = 195.1 brighter
than g = 18.0 for which u - g > 2.2. Retrieve the Object ID, ra, dec, and the
five final magnitudes.


select objID,ra,dec,u,g,r,i,z
from PhotoObj
where ra BETWEEN 194.9 and 195.1 AND
g > 18.0 AND
u-g > 2.2



Practice 4. What are the highest-redshift quasars in the SDSS database?

Write a query to search for quasars for which we have obtained spectra (search
the specObj table) with redshifts greater than 4.5 and high confidence
measurements (zconf > .35). Be sure to retrieve both quasars and the objects
classified as high-redshift quasars. Retrieve each quasar's Photo ID, ra, dec,
and redshift.



select bestObjID,z,zconf, specClass
from SpecObj
where z > 4.5 AND
zconf > .35 AND
specClass = 3 OR specClass = 4

How many results do you get?

select COUNT(*) as result_count
from SpecObj
where z > 4.5 AND
zconf > .35 AND
specClass = 3 OR specClass = 4


result_count
7875


Practice 5. How can you look up image data, plates and spectra of moderately
bright nearby galaxies?

Write a query to find galaxies for which we have spectra that have g magnitude
between 17 and 17.4 and redshift less than 0.05. For each galaxy, retrieve the
object ID, the five magnitudes (u,g,r,i,z), the redshift, the plate/MJD number,
and the fiber number.

select PhotoObj.g as g_mag,
PhotoObj.objID as ID,
PhotoObj.u as u_mag,
PhotoObj.r as r_mag,
PhotoObj.i as i_mag,
PhotoObj.z as z_mag,
SpecObj.z as redshift,
SpecObj.plate as Plate_num,
SpecObj.fiberID as Fiber_Num
from PhotoObj,SpecObj
where PhotoObj.g BETWEEN 17 and 17.4 AND
SpecObj.z < .05



Practice 6. What types (templates) of quasars have high redshifts?

Write a query to find the template number matched to all high redshift quasars
(redshift greater than 2.5). HINT: template number is in the Cross-Correlation
Redshifts table. Retrieve the objects' ra, dec, u, g, r, i, z, redshift, and
tempno.


select red.specObjID,
red.tempNo,
SpecObj.specObjID,
SpecObj.ra,
SpecObj.dec,
PhotoObj.u,
PhotoObj.g,
PhotoObj.r,
PhotoObj.i,
PhotoObj.z,
SpecObj.z as redshift

from SpecObj, XCRedshift red, PhotoObj
where SpecObj.specObjID = red.specObjID AND
PhotoObj.objID = SpecObj.bestObjID AND
SpecObj.z > 2.5
