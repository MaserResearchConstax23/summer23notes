Probing the AGN Nature of Maser Galaxy Hosts

Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (Maser) can be
detected in galaxy centers at levels 1E6 times more intense than that associated
with star formation in the spiral arms of the Milky Way. When in a disk-like
configuration (i.e., megamaser disks), megamasers offer unique opportunities for
direct geometric measurements of extragalactic distances and supermassive black
hole masses. However, disk-type megamaser sources are extremely rare (only about
34 are known). To find more of these sources, we need to better understand their
properties. This study investigates the connection between water maser emission
and their host galaxy traits. Specifically, We compare various independent
multi-wavelength diagnostics for actively accreting supermassive black holes
(Active Galactic Nuclei; AGN) in galaxy centers, as well as the host galaxy
environments, via the latest published cosmic void/wall galaxy identifications.

Probing the AGN Nature of Maser Galaxy Hosts

Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (maser) is detected
at incredibly intense levels in the centers of a tiny fraction of galaxies,
surpassing the intensity associated with star formation in the spiral arms of
our own Milky Way by a factor of 1E6. Megamaser disks, which are intense maser
sources in disk-like configurations orbiting a supermassive black hole, provide
unique opportunities for directly measuring extragalactic distances and
supermassive black hole masses; however, they are extremely rare. To discover
more of these sources, a better understanding of their properties is needed.
This study aims to explore the relationship between water maser emission and the
characteristics of their host galaxies. Suspecting that actively accreting
supermassive black holes (known as Active Galactic Nuclei or AGN) in the centers
of galaxies could serve as an energy source for maser disks, we compare known
maser hosts with known non-maser hosts using various multi-wavelength
diagnostics for AGN. We also compare the environments of the host galaxies,
using the most recently published identifications of cosmic voids and walls.
