A holy grail of astronomy is being about to definitively measure the distances
to galaxies independent of one's universal model, allowing astronomers to refine
and test their models. Galactic masers sources are celestial objects which
provide such a rare opportunity. Masers unidirectional bright radiation sources
at a single microwave wavelength (22.2 GHz). As masers, which are emitted by
particulate clouds, orbit a galaxy's central black hole, their visible emission
is redshifted and blueshifted by their rotational speed, allowing precise
measurements of the distance to the galaxy and the mass of the black hole. All
we must do to tap this vital source of data about our universe is to find these
disk maser sources; however, that has proven difficult. We only know of around
180 maser sources, a few of which orbit black holes in a disk shape. We suspect
that Active Galactic Nuclei (Black Holes which are actively accreting dust and
gas) may provide the powerful energy source required for maser emission. There
are several established AGN detection methods. This study attempts to further
the knowledge of maser source properties by comparing known masers with detected
AGN properties, with the hope of enabling astronomers to better find useful
maser sources. We compare masers to AGN detection via coronal line emission and
find a small but significant correlation between coronal-line-AGN and maser
emission. We also explore Mid-infrared AGN detection as well as the location of
masers in cosmic walls or voids.
